    - Despite thousands of IBM employees' outrage, CEO Ginni Rometty maintains close to the Trump administration, serving on his Strategic and Policy Forum and advising the administration.
    - In response to Trump's Muslim and refugee ban, over 100 technology companies signed a legal brief voicing support for the federal lawsuit against the Executive Order. IBM did not sign the brief.
  profit: IBM has received $1.7 billion in contracts from Immigration Customs (ICE) and Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to support harsh enforcement activities. Will they now bid on Trump's enforcement ramp-up?
  demands:
    - Withdraw from Trump's Business Council;
    - Issue a clear statement denouncing Trump's anti-immigrant, -refugee, and -Muslim agenda; and
    - Publicly commit to cease all work that contributes to that agenda, including not renewing or bidding on any ICE contracts.
